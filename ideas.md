The world needs an awesome app to watch the stars!

	I think we should be able to:

	CREATE A SUPERIOR STAR DATABASE:
		-Pulling information from that 'other' internet movie database, create your own custom star constellations! It's like a friends circle but for people you'll never meet, peon!
		-Find out esoteric information: preffered housing arrangements; least favorite scents; smallest pet owned as a child.
				*note: information availability subject to change or non-existence.

	SIX STEPS TO KEVIN BACON:
		-Delicious, delicious bacon. Want to see exactly how these stars align? Find out how with our Baconator (title pending):
			-See how many steps removed they are from Kevin (or anyone else)!
			-See what those steps are! (Did you know that the dog that played Beethoven was owned and trained by Karl Lewis Miller, who also trained animals for Cujo, which might in some way be related to Kevin Bacon? I'm no good at this game; that's what this part of the app is for!) 

	TRACK YOUR FAVORITE STARS ONLINE:
		-See what sites they're posting to!
		-Depending on the information they're putting out there, find out a PHYSICAL location from which they post! Ooh! Stalky!
			-Where did they eat?
			-Where are they sleeping?
				-With whom? Hyuk hyuk.


	AVOID NEWS FROM YOUR LEAST FAVORITE STARS (UNLESS THEY GET INJURED):
		-Can't stand Ryan Seacrest? Use our censoring service- don't worry about ever seeing his name pop up here! Unless he's in trouble!


	STAY AWAY FROM GARY BUSEY:
		-We don't have any information on Gary Busey.
