The world needs an awesome app to watch the stars!

	I think we should be able to:

	CREATE A SUPERIOR STAR DATABASE:
	-Pulling information from that 'other' internet movie database, create your own custom star constellations! It's like a friends circle but for people you'll never meet, peon!

	SIX STEPS TO KEVIN BACON:
	-Delicious, delicious bacon. Want to see exactly how these stars align? Find out how with our Baconator (title pending): see how many steps removed they are from Kevin (or anyone else).

	TRACK YOUR FAVORITE STARS ONLINE:
	-See what sites they're posting to!
			-Depending on the information they're putting out there, find out a PHYSICAL location from which they post! Ooh! Stalky!


	AVOID NEWS FROM YOUR LEAST FAVORITE STARS (UNLESS THEY GET INJURED):
		-Can't stand Ryan Seacrest? Use our censoring service- don't worry about ever seeing his name pop up here! Unless he's in trouble!
